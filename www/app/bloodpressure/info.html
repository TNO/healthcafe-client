    <b>Information about blood pressure</b>
    <p>
 Blood pressure is the force with which the heart pumps blood through your veins. This creates a pressure on the vessels. With an elevated blood pressure (hypertension), this pressure is so high that the walls of the vessels get damaged. 
</p>
<p>
Blood pressure consists of two values. The systolic blood pressure is the pressure that occurs when the heart contracts. The diastolic blood pressure is the pressure when the heart relaxes. 
</p>
<p>
A healthy blood pressure has a systole of 135 mmHg or lower, and a diastole of 90 mmHg or lower. 
</p>
